# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## üìú Project Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify tweets into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project also features an interactive web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to input text and see sentiment predictions in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Tweets are the primary source of data for this project. These tweets undergo preprocessing steps to clean the text, such as:
  - Converting text to lowercase
  - Removing punctuation, special characters, and numbers
  - Eliminating stopwords (common words with little predictive value)
  - Tokenization (splitting text into individual words)
- The preprocessed text is then transformed into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. TF-IDF helps represent the importance of words in a document relative to the entire dataset.

### Modeling with Random Forest
- The Random Forest algorithm is employed for the classification task. It is a robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and prevent overfitting.
- The model is trained on the transformed TF-IDF features to learn patterns in the data and predict sentiment labels.

### Deployment with Streamlit
- An interactive web application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input their own text and view sentiment predictions instantly.
- The app makes the project user-friendly and accessible, providing a simple interface for testing the model with real-world tweets.

## üöÄ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The raw Twitter data undergoes text cleaning and transformation into TF-IDF vectors.
2. **Model Training**:
   - The Random Forest model is trained on the processed data, using hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - The trained model is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in predicting sentiment.
4. **Web App Development**:
   - The Streamlit app is created to provide an easy-to-use interface for sentiment analysis. It takes user input, processes it using the trained model, and displays the sentiment results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and TF-IDF transformation.
  - `pandas` and `numpy`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Streamlit`: To build the interactive web application.
  - `nltk`: For natural language preprocessing tasks.
- **Random Forest Algorithm**: Used for the classification of sentiments.
- **TF-IDF**: To convert textual data into numerical features.

## üí° Use Cases
The project is particularly valuable for businesses in the following ways:
- **Brand Monitoring**: Analyze customer feedback and social media discussions to understand brand sentiment.
- **Market Research**: Gain insights into how customers perceive products or competitors.
- **Customer Service**: Automatically classify tweets into different sentiment categories for prioritized responses.
- **Product Improvement**: Use customer feedback to guide the development of products or services.

## üìà Results
The model achieves satisfactory performance in predicting the sentiment of tweets. Further improvements could include:
- Adding more data for training.
- Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model.
- Exploring more sophisticated NLP techniques like Word2Vec or BERT for feature extraction.
